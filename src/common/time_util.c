    /* There are four sources for the monotonic time on Windows:
     *
     * Three are based on a (1 msec accuracy, but only read periodically) clock chip:
     * - GetTickCount (GTC)
     *    32bit msec counter, updated each ~15msec, wraps in ~50 days
     * - GetTickCount64 (GTC64)
     *    Same as GetTickCount, but extended to 64bit, so no wrap
     *    Only available in Vista or later
     * - timeGetTime (TGT)
     *    similar to GetTickCount by default: 15msec, 50 day wrap.
     *    available in winmm.dll (thus known as the multimedia timers)
     *    However apps can raise the system timer clock frequency using timeBeginPeriod()
     *    increasing the accuracy up to 1 msec, at a cost in general system performance
     *    and battery use.
     *
     * One is based on high precision clocks:
     * - QueryPrecisionCounter (QPC)
     *    This has much higher accuracy, but is not guaranteed monotonic, and
     *    has lots of complications like clock jumps and different times on different
     *    CPUs. It also has lower long term accuracy (i.e. it will drift compared to
     *    the low precision clocks.
     *
     * Additionally, the precision available in the timer-based wakeup such as
     * MsgWaitForMultipleObjectsEx (which is what the mainloop is based on) is based
     * on the TGT resolution, so by default it is ~15msec, but can be increased by apps.
     *
     * The QPC timer has too many issues to be used as is. The only way it could be used
     * is to use it to interpolate the lower precision clocks. Firefox does something like
     * this:
     *   https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=363258
     *
     * However this seems quite complicated, so we're not doing this right now.
     *
     * The approach we take instead is to use the TGT timer, extending it to 64bit
     * either by using the GTC64 value, or if that is not available, a process local
     * time epoch that we increment when we detect a timer wrap (assumes that we read
     * the time at least once every 50 days).
     *
     * This means that:
     *  - We have a globally consistent monotonic clock on Vista and later
     *  - We have a locally monotonic clock on XP
     *  - Apps that need higher precision in timeouts and clock reads can call
     *    timeBeginPeriod() to increase it as much as they want
     */

     * have the same base and source (msecs since system boot).
     * They can differ by as much as -16 to +16 msecs.
     * We can't just inject the low bits into the 64bit counter
     * as one of the counters can have wrapped in 32bit space and
     * the other not. Instead we calculate the signed difference
     * in 32bit space and apply that difference to the 64bit counter.
